# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a minimal shopping cart application built with React and Redux. The application will demonstrate modern React patterns including Redux for state management, custom hooks, useMemo for performance optimization, and useRef for DOM manipulation. The app will provide a simple e-commerce experience where users can browse products, add them to a cart, and view their total cost and quantity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to view a list of available products with their names and prices, so that I can browse what's available for purchase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a list of products
2. WHEN displaying products THEN the system SHALL show the product name and price for each item
3. WHEN rendering the product list THEN the system SHALL use the products data from a centralized data source

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to add products to my shopping cart, so that I can collect items I wish to purchase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a product THEN the system SHALL display an "Add to Cart" button
2. WHEN I click "Add to Cart" THEN the system SHALL add the product to my cart with quantity 1
3. WHEN I add the same product multiple times THEN the system SHALL increment the quantity instead of creating duplicate entries
4. WHEN I add a product to cart THEN the system SHALL focus an input field using useRef for better user experience

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to view my shopping cart contents, so that I can see what items I have selected and their quantities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I have items in my cart THEN the system SHALL display each item with its name and quantity
2. WHEN my cart is empty THEN the system SHALL display a "No items" message
3. WHEN displaying cart items THEN the system SHALL show the format "Product Name x Quantity"

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to remove items from my shopping cart, so that I can change my mind about purchases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing cart items THEN the system SHALL display a "Remove" button for each item
2. WHEN I click "Remove" THEN the system SHALL completely remove that product from the cart
3. WHEN I remove an item THEN the system SHALL update the cart totals immediately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to see the total number of items and total cost in my cart, so that I can understand the scope and cost of my purchase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I have items in my cart THEN the system SHALL display the total number of items
2. WHEN I have items in my cart THEN the system SHALL display the total cost
3. WHEN cart contents change THEN the system SHALL recalculate totals using useMemo for performance optimization
4. WHEN calculating totals THEN the system SHALL use a custom hook for reusable logic

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to use Redux for state management, so that cart state is managed globally and predictably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing cart state THEN the system SHALL use Redux with Redux Toolkit
2. WHEN updating cart state THEN the system SHALL use Redux actions and reducers
3. WHEN components need cart data THEN the system SHALL use Redux selectors

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to demonstrate modern React patterns, so that it serves as a good example of current best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating derived values THEN the system SHALL use useMemo for performance optimization
2. WHEN accessing DOM elements THEN the system SHALL use useRef appropriately
3. WHEN creating reusable logic THEN the system SHALL implement custom hooks
4. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL use a modular component structure
